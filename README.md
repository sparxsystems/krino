The intention is to create an AI software tool that can help users to make decisions they can trust. At its core, Krino should be able to learn and converse with users on virtually any topic. It will be able to identify potential inconsistencies and misstatements. And because it is a white-box AI it always explain precisely why it provided any output.

*	Krino is, at its core, a combination of formal linguistics, constructive mathematics, argumentation theory and causality theory.
*	Krino’s job is to help the user make decisions.
*	Krino has foundational knowledge and will learn from other inputs, too (e.g. the user can give assumptions).
*	Krino should be usable in many different industries and ecosystems with the described data challenges.
*	Krino can communicate to the user that it doesn’t know something, that it is not sure, and/or that it does not have enough data.
*	Krino will be working on each word of an argument, not only on complete proposition like what has been done until now.
